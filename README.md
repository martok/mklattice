mklattice
=========

Lattice data file generator for use with [LAMMPS](http://lammps.sandia.gov/).

Can be used to generate files to be imported using `read_data` according to a specified
lattice and composition. Purpose-built for working with simple lattices (sc,bcc,fcc) and
B2 and DO3 phases of FeAl, but can be extended to other crystal structures. Atom types
vacancies and anti-sites are configured as needed.

Built with FreePascal 2.7, may or may not compile with Delphi or other FPC versions.
