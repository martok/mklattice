General
=======
Collection of tools to pre- and postprocess [LAMMPS](http://lammps.sandia.gov/) simulation
input and output files.

Built with FreePascal 2.7, may or may not compile with Delphi or other FPC versions.

mklattice
---------
Lattice data file generator.

Can be used to generate files to be imported using `read_data` according to a specified
lattice and composition. Purpose-built for working with simple lattices (sc,bcc,fcc) and
B2 and DO3 phases of FeAl, but can be extended to other crystal structures. Atom types
vacancies and anti-sites are configured as needed.

Built with FreePascal 2.7, may or may not compile with Delphi or other FPC versions.

dumputl
-------
Utility to split large LAMMPS dump files into handier parts, optionally compressing them using
gzip (.gz).

Can be used to create the single-frame file series that A. Stukowski's CrystalAnalysis-Tool requires
or to extract subranges from large dump files. Frame offsets are stored in a .idx Mapfile associated
with the input file to speed up any call after the first initial scan.

File name formatting uses normal Pascal [format strings](http://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/rtl/sysutils/format.html).
